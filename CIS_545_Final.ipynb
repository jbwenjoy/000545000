    "## **1.1 Problem Statement**\n",
    "Airfare pricing in the U.S. domestic airline industry has long been a topic of interest due to its dynamic and opaque nature. From 1993 to 2024, the industry has undergone substantial changes including fluctuating fuel prices, shifting market competition, and evolving consumer behavior. These factors make it difficult for travelers to anticipate ticket prices and for airlines to optimize revenue through effective pricing strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the abundance of large-scale data, there remains a lack of comprehensive, data-driven analyses that systematically explore the relationship between these variables and airfare trends. One of our team members is planning to book a flight during a holiday period and is particularly interested in understanding what drives changes in ticket prices. This curiosity sparked our interest and motivated us to investigate whether historical data could reveal meaningful patterns that help consumers make more informed travel decisions."

    "## **1.2 Objective and Value Proposition**\n",
    "The objective of this project is to conduct a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) of U.S. domestic airline fares from 1993 to 2024, and to develop predictive models that capture how different variables affect airfare pricing. The project integrates route and fare data with external economic indicators such as oil prices to uncover insights into airfare dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goals are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Understand Key Drivers of Pricing:** Investigate how factors like route distance, seasonality, fuel costs, airline competition, and passenger volume affect airfares.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Support Strategic Planning:** Provide insights to airline operators and policymakers for optimizing pricing strategies and understanding long-term market shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Build a Predictive Model:** Develop regression models capable of forecasting average fares given known market and economic conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value proposition of this project lies in offering a systematic and scalable framework for analyzing complex fare-setting behavior across three decades. For consumers, it may lead to better fare predictions and smarter booking decisions. For industry stakeholders, it provides tools for data-informed pricing and long-term planning."

    "- **Categorical Encoding**: We identified `quarter`, `citymarketid_1`, and `citymarketid_2` as categorical variables, despite being numeric in appearance. These, along with other nominal features such as `city1`, `airport_1`, and `carrier_lg`, were one-hot encoded to convert them into a format suitable for machine learning models.\n",
    "- **Target Variable**: We selected `fare` as the prediction target, representing the average airfare for each route.\n",
    "- **Train-Test Split**: The dataset was split into 80% for training and 20% for testing, ensuring unbiased model evaluation.\n",
    "- **Feature Scaling**: Continuous numerical features were standardized using `StandardScaler` to ensure they are on the same scale, which benefits many machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA was applied to retain 95% of the variance while reducing the dimensionality of the feature space, helping to speed up model training and reduce the risk of overfitting.\n",

Since using Git with .ipynb is very unpleasant, I recommend installing jupytext

```bash
conda install jupytext -c conda-forge
```

Then, you can convert between .ipynb and .py files by running `ipynb2py.py` or `py2ipynb.py` in the root directory of the repository.

Always remember to convert ipynb into py and clean the notebook outputs when commiting.
